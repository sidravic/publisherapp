== Working with RabbitMQ running within Rails

The application runs the reactor as a separate thread and is launched using the Unicorn configuration file.
Check <tt> config/unicorn.rb </tt>.

The messages published on next_tick are to verify if the setup is working. The actually messages would be 
published as a result of some user interaction. In this case a <tt> GET </tt> request to <tt> /posts </tt>
would trigger a message publish.

Check <tt> app/models/message.rb </tt>
